docme
=====

A documentation generator


###Usage

Provide a file from the command line (see the `/test` folder for syntax examples).

`ruby docme.rb <path_to_file>`

`ruby docme.rb test/testJS.js`

Currently just parses and splits the file based on the initial syntax designs and prints the output to the console.
